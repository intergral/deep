# Tracepoints

Tracepoints are the way Deep defines the actions it will take. A tracepoint is primarily a code location (file name and
line number), however, there can also be other configurations that control how the data is collected and any
restrictions the client should make.

For details of the structure of a tracepoint see the [proto definition](https://github.com/intergral/deep-proto/blob/master/deepproto/proto/tracepoint/v1/tracepoint.proto).
